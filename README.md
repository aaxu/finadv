# FinAdv
Financial advising android app, made for HackIntoIt 3.0 hackathon. Using Google Maps API to perform location tracking.
If the app detects that you are in a commercial establishment (currently supporting only restaurants), then a notification
will be sent to your phone and it will display your budget.

You can set your budget through the app and update it with your costs.
